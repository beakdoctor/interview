# Project goals
Get prepared enough to pass a coding interview at any great software company of
interest, and also to have some fun with challenging code problems again.

# Preparing for an interview
Useful resources:

* a good algorithm book
* something like leetcode/hackerrank/4Clojure with interactive problems
* a whiteboard

Potentially useful activities:

* problem classification
* work on a good problem solving algorithm

## Platforms
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)

[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

Dynamic programming is a tool to solve optimization problems. That is, problems where we seek to maximize or minimize some function.

If we have a recursive algorithm that repeatedly computes the same input over and over again, dynamic programming can be used to make it more efficient by storing the result of each computation in a look-up table. We can call this "top down" thinking.

The next trick is to eliminate the recursion entirely by using "bottom up" thinking.

To be continued...
